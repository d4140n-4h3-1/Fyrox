//! Shadows that come from somewhere other than shadow maps.
//!
//! A shadow map is a picture of the scene from the light, drawn every frame for every light that
//! casts shadows, so a scene with many lamps can afford them for only a few. A [`LightShadowTracer`]
//! replaces those pictures: for each light, just before the light is drawn, it produces a mask the
//! size of the screen that says which pixels the light reaches. The light pass reads the mask where
//! it would otherwise look up its shadow map, so the shadow darkens that light's contribution alone.
//!
//! The renderer knows nothing about how the mask is made - ray tracing hardware, typically - and
//! falls back to shadow maps for any light the tracer returns nothing for.
